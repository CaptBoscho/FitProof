# FitProof Development Blueprint

## High-Level Architecture Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Project setup and basic infrastructure
- Database design and GraphQL API foundation
- Basic mobile app structure

### Phase 2: Core Exercise Detection (Weeks 3-4)
- MediaPipe integration
- Pose detection and landmark extraction
- Basic exercise validation logic

### Phase 3: Workout Recording (Weeks 5-6)
- Camera integration and UI
- Real-time feedback and rep counting
- Local data storage

### Phase 4: Backend Integration (Weeks 7-8)
- GraphQL mutations and queries
- Data synchronization
- Offline support

### Phase 5: User Management (Weeks 9-10)
- Authentication system
- User profiles and data
- Basic social features

### Phase 6: Points & Achievements (Weeks 11-12)
- Points calculation and tracking
- Achievement system
- Friends and leaderboards

## Development Strategy

### 1. Backend-First Approach
Start with a solid backend foundation that can be tested independently before mobile integration.

### 2. Test-Driven Development
Every feature should have comprehensive tests before implementation.

### 3. Incremental Integration
Each step should integrate with previous work, avoiding orphaned code.

### 4. Early Validation
Test core assumptions (pose detection accuracy) as early as possible.

## Detailed Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. Initialize projects and dependencies
2. Database schema and migrations
3. GraphQL server with basic queries
4. Mobile app with navigation structure
5. CI/CD pipeline setup

### Phase 2: Core Exercise Detection
1. MediaPipe pose detection proof-of-concept
2. Landmark extraction and processing
3. Angle calculation utilities
4. Exercise validation logic for pushups
5. Exercise validation for situps and squats

### Phase 3: Workout Recording
1. Camera component with MediaPipe integration
2. Real-time pose detection UI
3. Rep counting and validation feedback
4. Workout session management
5. Local SQLite storage for workout data

### Phase 4: Backend Integration
1. GraphQL mutations for workout data
2. Data synchronization service
3. Offline queue management
4. Conflict resolution for multi-device sync
5. Background sync and retry logic

### Phase 5: User Management
1. Authentication with email/password
2. Social login (Google/Apple)
3. User profile management
4. Friends system (search and invite)
5. Privacy controls and data visibility

### Phase 6: Points & Achievements
1. Points calculation and tracking
2. Streak calculation and bonus logic
3. Achievement definition and unlocking
4. Weekly challenges system
5. Leaderboards and social competition

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **MediaPipe Performance**: Test on multiple devices early
- **Real-time Processing**: Implement performance monitoring
- **Offline Sync Complexity**: Start with simple scenarios first

### Product Risks
- **Exercise Accuracy**: Validate with real users early
- **User Engagement**: Implement analytics from day one
- **Scalability**: Design for growth but don't over-engineer

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Pose detection accuracy > 90%
- App performance > 60fps during recording
- Data sync success rate > 99%
- Crash rate < 1%

### Product Metrics
- User retention after 7 days > 30%
- Average workout frequency > 3x/week
- Friend invitation acceptance rate > 50%
- Achievement completion rate > 60%
